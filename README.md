# AI-based-game
Trying to develop a game where the enemy evolves as the NN trains
Ignore the basics file, it was just me getting familiar with the environment. 
Game file has a basic game with a MC, a blob enemy and your ability to kill it. An OOP based approach was found to be the best one and hence initial approach seen in basics file was discarded. 
Once a basic game env is developed am starting work on different types of AI models which I can introduce.
