# AI-based-game
Trying to develop a game where the enemy evolves as the AI model trains.\
Changelog0.1 : Ignore the basics file, it was just me getting familiar with the environment.\
               Game file has a basic game with a MC, a blob enemy and your ability to kill it. An OOP based approach was found to be the                   best one and hence initial approach seen in basics file was discarded.\
Once a basic game env is developed am starting work on different types of AI models which I can introduce.

Changelog0.2 : Forking the possible game AIs based on(hence 4 files with 4 AI implementations of blob):
1. FSM
2. Monte Carlo Search Tree
3. Genetic/Generational NN
4. Behavioural Decision Trees

Jumped onto GNN a bit early. MCST and BDT seemes to be linked and hence it makes sense to implement it first. Will implement a behavioral decition tree first.
